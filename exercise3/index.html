    <h1>Remy the Rat</h1>
    <img src="remy.png" width="200" height="300" class="remy" />
    <p>
      Remy is a rat who simply adores food. He has a friend who is a spectral
      representation of the late Gusteau, Remy's hero. He is shown to have a
      very good sense of smell so Remy's father gave him a job as
      poison-checker. Due to his gift with food, he always thinks that his
      thoughts are always correct, which they always are, and always tries his
      best to make the food he makes high-standard. He also has an interest in
      humans because of how they customize food and soon becomes quite close to
      one particular human, Alfredo Linguini, who affectionately calls him
      "Little Chef" and cannot cook.
    </p>

    <p>
      He is not a typical rat, and his personality is mostly like one of a
      human, as he walks on two feet instead of four. He thinks of his talent
      modestly as shown when Linguini asked him if he could actually cook. His
      father is always concerned that Remy does not act like a typical rat and
      always ends up arguing with Remy.
    </p>

    <p>
      His overall dream is to become a chef, and he is always tempted to cook
      wherever he finds what he needs. When he finds Linguini, and realizes he
      can control his actions with his hair, he immediately cooks food of
      extremely high-standard, hiding under Linguini's chef's hat. Everyone buys
      his dishes by asking for the "Special Order."
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of Ratatouille, Remy's dream comes true and he becomes a chef
      at La Ratatouille bistro in Paris.
