    <p id="paragraph">
      According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be
      able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the
      ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what
      humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
      Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry!
      Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? -
      Can you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking
      sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm
      excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect
      report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got
      lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
      - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
